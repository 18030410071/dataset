# Deltille detector dataset
This dataset contains images used in robot hand (folder `robot-hand`) and fisheye (folder `fisheye`) experiments in our
[paper](https://research.fb.com/publications/deltille-grids-for-geometric-camera-calibration). The deltille and rectangular patterns
used to print the targets are available in folder `patterns`.

For additional details please consult our [paper](https://research.fb.com/publications/deltille-grids-for-geometric-camera-calibration)
 or contact the authors.
